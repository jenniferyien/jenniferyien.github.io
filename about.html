                    <p> I worked as an educator teaching high school for two years,
                      where I developed a new digital arts curriculum and led creation of
                      all marketing collateral. At that time my goal is to increase awareness
                      and foster proper utilization of the arts to aid in the creation of a collaborative society. </p>

                    <p> After my two years teaching, I wanted to grow my personal skill sets more,
                      so I ventured out and joined an education startup. My primary responsibility
                      was to support users in onboarding and utilizing our product to its full potential.
                      My product knowledge grew and I started to work with the engineering team on certain projects.
                      I began helping test features before release and reporting bugs when I found them, assisting with QA. </p>

                    <p> The more I continued to work with developers though,
                      the more I have become fascinated by what they can do.
                      I desperately wanted to be able to contribute to the development of a product.
                      I believe that developers are the heart of what makes a product,
                      and at the core of any business. I personally want to learn more
                      and professionally grow my skill sets to be a part of that core and
                      contribute in the most impactful way. </p>
