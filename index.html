            Hi, I’m Jenn. I like to build things that make life easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently work at JustWorks as a software engineer.
            Before that, I worked at WeWork, WeddingWire, and
            Newsela — teaching digital art to high schoolers in
            a <a href="https://jennwu.weebly.com/" target='_blank'>prior life</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experiences have played a critical role in the way
            I approach software development. What you build is only
            as good as the experience you design. I value the collaboration
            of my team as much as my individutal contribution.
            The whole can always be more than the sum of its parts.
          </p>

          Oh, you actually scrolled down here? Well,
          I also love bubble tea and jalapeno chips.
          Not necessarily together, but I won’t stop you.
